## fnv_yaml

A command-line program for creating and editing `sound_volume_fighter_num_table.fnv` files using YAML. Drag and drop a `sound_volume_fighter_num_table.fnv` file onto the executable to create a YAML file. Drag and drop a properly structured YAML file onto the executable to create a `sound_volume_fighter_num_table.fnv` file. YAML files are text files, so they can be viewed and edited in any text editor.

```yaml
entries:
- fighter_num: 2
